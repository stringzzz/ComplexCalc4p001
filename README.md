# ComplexCalc4p003
A Python/tKinter GUI Calculator for dealing with Complex number calculations

I am sure there is a much better way to do this, but this is what I have so far.

Keyboard shortcuts:

m: Mod

a: Arg

e: e^

l: Log

s: Sin

c: Cos

t: Tan

p: Power (a^b) (Enter base number before pressing 'p')
 
_ (Space): Clear screen
 
v: Input to variable
 
w, x, y, z: Use variable (After v to input, or without v to output stored value) (Click 'save' to store the variables in an external file for later use)
 
(ENTER): Compute

After computation, press any operation or function to use the result of the previous computation


To change the calculator's skin: Set line 1 of the 'calcMemory.txt' file in the inclusive range of 0-3:

0: Blue

1: Green

2: Red

3: Purple
